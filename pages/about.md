Macramè was founded in 2004, in north-east Italy, the region well-known for its entrepreneurial spirit.

Conceived as a network of professionals with the aim of providing quality communication design services at a fair price.

Today what people want is just a click away. This means that things are fast and simple. People expect quality products at a reasonable price.

Macramè anticipated the way the world is working today: it’s on-demand and global. Our collaborators are based all over the world, but work together to create fast, affordable communication design solutions.

We’ve invested a lot of time and energy in selecting our network. We’ve done it with care and by considering each member’s special set of skills, professionalism and honesty. We give them the same attention we give to our clients. One can’t go without the other.

We can respond to the specific demands of our clients, and find the best solution at a fair price

That’s what makes us different.
