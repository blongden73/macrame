**Macramé was founded in 2004** in northeast Italy, a region known for its entrepreneurial spirit, **as a network of professionals** that would provide communication and design services at reasonable prices.

**Today most things people seek are just a click away.** This means that things are fast and simple and people expect quality products at a reasonable price.

**Macramé was a step ahead of this trend:** its services are on-demand and global. Our collaborators are based all over the world but work together to create fast, affordable communication and design solutions.

**We've invested a lot of time and energy in putting together our network.** We’ve done it with care, considering each member’s special set of skills, professionalism and honesty. We give them the same attention we give our clients because they are equally important.

We can respond to the specific demands of our clients and find the best solution at a fair price.

That’s what makes us different.
