intro_paragraph: The story of **Martín Graziano**, Designer, Art Director and
  back to the roots guy looking for peace of mind.

  section: >-
    A few decades ago, in Buenos Aires, Argentina, Martin Graziano was born. His
    childhood was similar to every Argentinian kid of that time. With one
    exception.\

    \

    **Martín’s grandfather was a carpenter.** He had a shop. little Martín spent hours and hours learning how to work the wood. How to shape it and how to make amazing things with it. As he recalls: “I grew up at that shop. Surrounded by my grandfather’s sawdust and all the tools. It was part of my childhood. It’s who I am.”

    **He grew up, indeed, but not to become a carpenter. But a graphic designer and art director instead.** We might think those careers are not alike, but they are.\

    \

    **Working the wood is a creative job.** You turn a raw material into an idea. You give it shape. You model it. Same thing happens to an idea.\

    You start from a white canvas and you build on that. You create, you shape. You make that raw idea a poster, or website, or live event.\

    \

    **So yes, we could say his grandparent shaped Martín future.** Without even knowing it.\

    \

    **That’s maybe why he now lives in Galicia, Spain, from where his grandparent originally was.** He moved there by chance. But he found there the peace of mind he needed to be the best graphic designer he could be. The madness of Buenos Aires advertising and design environment was way gone. Peaceful Galicia was now his real home.

    **However this long journey started a long time ago,** when Martín was finishing high school. He had a few classes on design and advertising and knew his future was going that way. And he got his first job at an editorial house. He was a self-taught designer at that time. He did fine, but at some point he realized: ​“If I want to move forward I have to study.”\

    \

    **He graduated from the Graphic Design Career** at Universidad de Buenos Aires and then studied the Art Direction Career at the Asociación Argentina de Agencias de Publicidad.\

    \

    And that went quite well.

  section3: >-
    **He got his first award while he was studying.** The client, Itaú Bank, one
    of the most important banks in Latin America. Maybe that early award shaped
    him, in a way, and led him to work for Itaú Bank, BBVA Bank and Santander
    Bank; three of the most important banking companies in the world.\

    \

    **The same award that also led to one of the most creative advertising agencies in Argentina** at that time. Crazy hours, crazy weekends. The Mad Men life was not for him. But he learnt a lot there, despite the fact he was not aware he was learning. Now, at the distance he can look back and realize that being ad-educated was quite significant for the problem solver creative he is today.\

    \

    **The advertising approached helped him be a better designer, a better art director.** An That’s what he thinks is the main difference between him and newly graduated designers. “One of the things I noticed by working with younger people is that most of the time they find it difficult to turn an abstract idea into a real piece of work.”\

    \

    **That’s his main strength.** He has not only the designer tools. He’s well trained into the ad world. And that perfect mix is what makes him different. What makes him create powerful, full-of-content creative assets.\

    \

    **That’s why he can solve different briefings**, from branding to illustration, editorial design or even a campaign. That’s why he can work for such a wide variety of brands such as Orbis, Dermaglos, Samsung or Disney Latin America.

    \

    **And that’s why he enjoys working with Macramé**, where he can balance his personal and professional life in a unique way. Choosing not only the amount of time he spends on each job, but also where he lives and how much time he spends with his family. And that’s a lot to say. Specially in the crazy, fast-pacing world we live in these days.\

    \

    **Maybe that’s the reason why he’s been working for Macramé for the past 12 years.** Maybe that’s the reason why all his clients wants to keep working with him.\

    \

    **Maybe that’s the top skill of this wise man** who escaped from the Mad Men world to work from the peace of his grandfather’s homeland.
