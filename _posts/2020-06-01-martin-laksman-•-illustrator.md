  his hands to draw all his games.

  section: >-
    Born in 1976 in the west-side neighbourhood outside of Buenos Aires, Martin
    Laksman always wanted to be a goalkeeper. His dream: helping the club of his
    heart, Independiente, to conquer the world, again.


    \

    **He played many years and enjoyed football a lot,** but at some point he quit, to pursue a career in illustration and graphic design.\

    We might start wondering what might have happened if he kept playing football.

    **But the truth is that there’s a way more important question here:** was he a great goalkeeper because his hands were used to drawing amazing stuff? Or is he a talented illustrator because his hands were used to avoid angry balls from hitting the net?\

    \

    **We’ll never know that for sure.** But what we do know is that since his early years he enjoyed drawing. And playing football of course. But in his own words: “All the memories I have are of me drawing stuff”.
