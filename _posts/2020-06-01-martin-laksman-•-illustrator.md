  section: >-
    Born in 1976 in the west-side neighbourhood outside of Buenos Aires, Martin
    Laksman always wanted to be a goalkeeper. His dream: helping the club of his
    heart, Independiente, to conquer the world, again.


    \

    **He played many years and enjoyed football a lot,** but at some point he quit, to pursue a career in illustration and graphic design.\

    We might start wondering what might have happened if he kept playing football.
