intro_paragraph: >-
  Born in 1976 in the west-side neighbourhood outside of Buenos Aires, Martin
  Laksman always wanted to be a goalkeeper. His dream: helping the club of his
  heart, Independiente, to conquer the world, again.\

  He played many years and enjoyed football a lot, but at some point he quit, to pursue a career in illustration and graphic design.\

  We might start wondering what might have happened if he kept playing football.
