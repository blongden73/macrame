intro_paragraph: The story of  **Martín Laksman**,  or the goalkeeper, that used
  his hands to draw all his games.

  section: >-
    Born in 1976 in the west-side neighbourhood outside of Buenos Aires, Martin
    Laksman always wanted to be a goalkeeper. His dream: helping the club of his
    heart, Independiente, to conquer the world, again.


    \

    **He played many years and enjoyed football a lot,** but at some point he quit, to pursue a career in illustration and graphic design.\

    We might start wondering what might have happened if he kept playing football.

    **But the truth is that there’s a way more important question here:** was he a great goalkeeper because his hands were used to drawing amazing stuff? Or is he a talented illustrator because his hands were used to avoid angry balls from hitting the net?\

    \

    **We’ll never know that for sure.** But what we do know is that since his early years he enjoyed drawing. And playing football of course. But in his own words: “All the memories I have are of me drawing stuff”.

    **And that’s a lot to say for a guy who started a career in illustration and graphic design many years ago** and is now an awarded and showcased artist working for Coca-Cola, Gatorade, Time Inc., Under Armour, ESPN, Sports Illustrated and the Bundesliga, among others.\

    \

    **When asked about his very first memories** of his developing talent he can highlight the very first comic book he created and a portrait of his father. Which he illustrated at the age of ten. What was his source of inspiration at that time, he does not remember, but what he does remember is the voice of his mother telling him to draw, or as he remembers: “You have to let kids, be.”\

    \

    **No matter how good you are**, finding inspiration is quite tricky for many creatives. Martin or Laks -for his friends and colleagues- enjoys music, movies and TV shows and the most important of all: traveling.\

    \

    **He make time for traveling** and he does that not only to escape from the daily routine, but also to boost his hunger for ideas, art and new trends. Flying to different locations around the world allows him to attend congresses, visit museums and even have a 30-minutes coffee talk with someone he admires.

    That and his beloved Club Atlético Independiente. The football club of his
    dreams. The football club he’s playing for right now. In a way. His love for
    the club made him reach the marketing department and offer them his skills.\

    \

    He could do a lot for Independiente and he knew it. That’s why we can say it’s one of his most important clients right now. And a source of daily inspiration and motivation. Actually the devil’s illustration on Independiente ’s jersey is one of the many works of Martin Laksman for the club.
