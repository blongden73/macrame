    Once upon a time there was a little girl who dreamt to be a figure skater.
    ​She did not know why she was so into it but there was something about the
    shapes that really matter to her.\

    \

    **Precise shapes. Beautiful shapes**. Something both figure skating and design had in common. That’s why after watching ​Ice Castles​ she decides it was not for her. But she still wanted to create shapes, in a slightly different way.\

    \

    **She started thinking of design** when she was at school. At first it was ​Industrial Design​ what she had in mind, because ​“you create actual things”.

    **At some point ​one of her teachers gave a class on Fonts**. She did not know that could be something you do for a living. She hadn’t even considered Graphic Design till that precise moment. But those shapes stayed in her mind. And she gave that a try.\

    \

    **Surprise, surprise... she loved it.** She loved everything about it. She loved the career, the ways of thinking and doing. She loved every single letter, every single family and that love made her see fonts form a completely different perspective.
