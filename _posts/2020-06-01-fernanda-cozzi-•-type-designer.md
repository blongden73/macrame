intro_paragraph: The story of **Fer Cozzi**, the figure-skater-dreamer who who
  wrote her story with her own fonts.
sections:
  section: >-
    Once upon a time there was a little girl who dreamt to be a figure skater.
    ​She did not know why she was so into it but there was something about the
    shapes that really matter to her.\

    \

    **Precise shapes. Beautiful shapes**. Something both figure skating and design had in common. That’s why after watching ​Ice Castles​ she decides it was not for her. But she still wanted to create shapes, in a slightly different way.\

    \

    **She started thinking of design** when she was at school. At first it was ​Industrial Design​ what she had in mind, because ​“you create actual things”.


    > "You create actual things"

    >

    > \-On Design


    **At some point ​one of her teachers gave a class on Fonts**. She did not know that could be something you do for a living. She hadn’t even considered Graphic Design till that precise moment. But those shapes stayed in her mind. And she gave that a try.\

    \

    **Surprise, surprise... she loved it.** She loved everything about it. She loved the career, the ways of thinking and doing. She loved every single letter, every single family and that love made her see fonts form a completely different perspective.
  section2: >-
    > "It’s not the style what makes the difference is the actual font!"

    >

    > \- On Illustration


    **She started taking extra classes on Typography and Calligraphy**, shaping her career based on the love she had for letters. And ​now she sells her own fonts.\

    \

    **Fully inspired by people, music and movies,** this typographer, calligrapher and designer, from Argentina has lectured several workshops on experimental typography, calligraphy and monograms.\

    \

    **She’s a regular collaborator in the biennial Tipos Latinos Argentina** since 2010, and her Síncopa Font has been selected for renowned Typography Exhibitions, such as Tipos Latinos and Pangramme.\

    \

    **Is this talent fueled by mate, wine, food and the crappy argentinian mood set?**\

    Maybe. Maybe not.\

    \

    **But she has a completely different approach to design** for being a letter lover, a letter expert.\

    \

    And that’s for sure.


    > "In the long run is always better and cheaper to develop you own font"

    >

    > \- On Brand & Fonts
  section3: >-
    **She knows that her knowledge on fonts gives her work a completely
    different perspective** mainly because most graphic designers are still not
    there. ​You can choose a family based on the idea. But even in one family
    you have a lot of different fonts. And of course it is not the same one or
    the other: “It’s not the style what makes the difference. Is the actual
    font!”\

    \

    **We can try to explain how typography is getting more and more important,** but there’s no better way to put it than on her own words: “At first we could say it was romanticism one font this or the other font, that. Now is a matter of budget. In the long run is always better and cheaper, to develop your own font”.\

    \

    **We can agree or disagree**, but companies like Apple, Google, Netflix and Spotify doing so is definitely and interesting proof to her point.
  section4: >-
    > "Managing ideas from Argentina while producing in Europe. So fun and
    challenging"

    >

    > \- On Macramé Network


    **But she’s not only a letter fan. She’s also a devoted teacher.**\

    Both to her post-graduate students, her previous students at ​Universidad de Buenos Aires and also the people she works with.\

    \

    **And that shaped her working network.**\

    “I mostly work with students and former students of mine. That’s my trusted network”.\

    Yes, she loves teaching. Even if it’s not a class.\

    \

    **That’s what she loves the most about working with Macramé.** ​There’s a lot of people involved on every single project and you get to learn a lot, and teach a lot to your pairs.\

    \

    **​And that was something she could see working** on the identity design for Pizzería Al-4. On which she (and the team) had to think the whole project from scratch. Concepts, ideas, deliverables, etc. With absolute freedom to come up with innovative ideas, from the menu to the card holder and other assets.\

    \

    “The most difficult part was managing ideas, tests and drafts from Argentina while producing in Europe. It was so fun and challenging.”
  section5: >-
    **That’s the story of this girl who fell deeply in love with letters**. So
    deeply that her beloved hedgehog Aydeé, who was at her side for over 5
    years, has her own font.\

    \

    **So deeply that she was awarded** the ​Sello Buen Diseño​ in 2018 and selected as one of the ten ​Ascenders by the Type Directors Club​ –a selection of designers under the age of 35 who show remarkable achievement in typography, type design, and lettering– in 2019.
