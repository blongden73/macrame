  section: >-
    Once upon a time there was a little girl who dreamt to be a figure skater.
    ​She did not know why she was so into it but there was something about the
    shapes that really matter to her.\

    \

    **Precise shapes. Beautiful shapes**. Something both figure skating and design had in common. That’s why after watching ​Ice Castles​ she decides it was not for her. But she still wanted to create shapes, in a slightly different way.\

    \

    **She started thinking of design** when she was at school. At first it was ​Industrial Design​ what she had in mind, because ​“you create actual things”.

    **At some point ​one of her teachers gave a class on Fonts**. She did not know that could be something you do for a living. She hadn’t even considered Graphic Design till that precise moment. But those shapes stayed in her mind. And she gave that a try.\

    \

    **Surprise, surprise... she loved it.** She loved everything about it. She loved the career, the ways of thinking and doing. She loved every single letter, every single family and that love made her see fonts form a completely different perspective.

    **She started taking extra classes on Typography and Calligraphy**, shaping her career based on the love she had for letters. And ​now she sells her own fonts.\

    \

    **Fully inspired by people, music and movies,** this typographer, calligrapher and designer, from Argentina has lectured several workshops on experimental typography, calligraphy and monograms.\

    \

    **She’s a regular collaborator in the biennial Tipos Latinos Argentina** since 2010, and her Síncopa Font has been selected for renowned Typography Exhibitions, such as Tipos Latinos and Pangramme.\

    \

    **Is this talent fueled by mate, wine, food and the crappy argentinian mood set?**\

    Maybe. Maybe not.\

    \

    **But she has a completely different approach to design** for being a letter lover, a letter expert.\

    \

    And that’s for sure.

    **She knows that her knowledge on fonts gives her work a completely
    different perspective** mainly because most graphic designers are still not
    there. ​You can choose a family based on the idea. But even in one family
    you have a lot of different fonts. And of course it is not the same one or
    the other: “It’s not the style what makes the difference. Is the actual
    font!”\

    \

    **We can try to explain how typography is getting more and more important,** but there’s no better way to put it than on her own words: “At first we could say it was romanticism one font this or the other font, that. Now is a matter of budget. In the long run is always better and cheaper, to develop your own font”.\

    \

    **We can agree or disagree**, but companies like Apple, Google, Netflix and Spotify doing so is definitely and interesting proof to her point.
